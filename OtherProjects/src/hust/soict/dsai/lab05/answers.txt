Q:  The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are called.
    What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?
A:  When an exception occurs, it causes the current method to stop and if the runtime system
    doesn't catch it, the runtime system will terminate the program and print a stack trace to the standard error output.
