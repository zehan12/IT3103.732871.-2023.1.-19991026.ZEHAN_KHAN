LAB 02: PROBLEM MODELING AND ENCAPSULATION
ANSWER SHEET

-------
Q:  If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category.
    Does Java allow you to do this?
A:  Java DOES NOT ALLOW you to create two constructors with the same number of arguments of the same type.
    This is because Java uses the number and type of parameters to differentiate between overloaded constructors
    Since both the title and the category are likely to be String types, you cannot have both a constructor that takes a single String for the title and another that takes a single String for the category.
