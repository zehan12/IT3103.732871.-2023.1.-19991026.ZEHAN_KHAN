Q:  Is Java a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
A:  Java is a pass-by-value programming language. Which means that when you pass a variable to a method,
    what is passed is a COPY of the variable's value, not the variable itself.
    For primitive types, this value is the actual data, whereas for objects, the passed value is the reference to the object.

Q:  After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
A:  `jungleDVD` and `cinderellaDVD` are copies of the references to these objects, not the objects themselves.
    Inside the swap method, the changes are made to these copies of references (o1 and o2).
    These changes do not affect the original references (`jungleDVD` and `cinderellaDVD`) in the `main` method

-------
Q:  After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
A:  Java, being a pass-by-value language, sends a copy of the reference to the `jungleDVD` object to the `changeTitle` method.
    Since both dvd and jungleDVD POINTING TO THE SAME OBJECT.
    -> Changing the title of the object via the `dvd` reference impacts the object that `jungleDVD` is referring to as well.
